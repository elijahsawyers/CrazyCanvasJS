# CrazyCanvasJS

Draw images and other objects onto a canvas with the ability to pan around and zoom.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you are running this in a modern web browser, and because the JavaScript code is using ES6 imports and exports, you'll need to setup a local server. I recommend using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

## Build With

* [HTML Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Canvas)
